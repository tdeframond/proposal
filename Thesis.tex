\section{Introduction}
Title project : \Large Functional testing and qualification of the Serval Mesh Extender
\normalsize \par
The Serval Project is a suite of technologies designed to facilitate and sustain mobile telecommunications in the absence of supporting infrastructure, such as cellular networks or electricity. \par The two main components of the Serval Project are the Serval Mesh Extender Hardware and the Serval Mesh App. Basically the Serval Mesh Extender is a low-cost communications relay device that extends the range of communications among phones using Wifi technologie. 

For the year 2017, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have commissioned the University to pilot Serval in the Pacific. Consequently, we have to prepare the Serval Mesh Extender technologies for field use in tropical-maritime environments, and without any dependencies on mains electricity. To this end the first Serval Mesh Extender is being redesigned to satisfy these requirements. However, this process is not yet complete. \par

\section{Project Focus}

Therefore there is a need to devise and apply a testing regime for the new Serval Mesh Extender design, to ensure that it meets the necessary functional requirements. Moreover we also have to ensure that the hardware units are easily possible to manufacturing. The focus of my project will be on the creation and application of such test protocols in order to be sure that the Serval Mesh Extender devices are ready for deployment in the field pilot. 

\section{Background Survey}
\subsection{The Pacific Humanitarian Challenge}

In November 2015 the Australian government called innovators, entrepreneurs, designers and academics to rethink humanitarian response with the Pacific Humanitarian Challenge. It received 129 applications from 20 countries across five continents in which they chose only five winners. The Serval Project is obviously one of them and since then has been piloting and implementing
